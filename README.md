Spell Checker Using Natural Language Processing is an algorithm based source code written in JAVA programming language. Doing spelling mistakes is common, mainly there are two types of spelling errors syntactical and semantical which we already discussed in above abstract.
Now in here we mainly focuses on the “Syntactical Errors”. To avoid this, we are implementing an algorithm called Spelling Correction Using Noisy Channel Model by Mark D.Kemighan, Kenneth W. Church, William A. Galethat.
The program reads a list of misspelled words by the user and prints a set of candidate corrections for each word on the output screen. This program also produces the probability of each corrected word (unless there is only one candidate correction).
Generally, spell mistakes are introduced into words, in of one of the following ways:
1.	Insertion – Inserting xy instead of character x.
2.	Deletion – Deleting x from xy.
3.	Substitution – Substituting a character x instead of character y.
4.	Reversal – Reversing characters xy as yx.
